Deep learning is an important artificial intelligence tool, which plays a crucial role in solving many complex computer vision problems [5, 6]. Deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used extensively for various image classification problems. However, such models perform optimally only when they are provided with a large amount of data. For biomedical image classification problems, such a vast amount of labeled data is difficult to acquire because it requires that expert doctors classify each image, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. Transfer learning is a work-around to surmount this obstacle. In this technique, to solve a problem that involves a small dataset, a model trained on a large dataset is re-used and the network weights determined in this model are applied. CNN models trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet [7], which consists of more than 14 million images, are frequently used for biomedical image classification tasks.

Ensemble learning is a popular strategy in which the decisions of multiple classifiers are fused to obtain the final prediction for a test sample. It is performed to capture the discriminative information from all the base classifiers, and thus, results in more accurate predictions. Some of the ensemble techniques that were most frequently used in studies in the literature are average probability, weighted average probability, and majority voting. The average probability-based ensemble assigns equal priority to each constituent base learner. However, for a particular problem, a certain base classifier may be able to capture information better than others. Thus, a more effective strategy is to assign weights to all the base classifiers.
